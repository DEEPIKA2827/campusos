# 📄 CampusOS — Executive Product Draft & Review Guide

**Document Target:** Senior Mentor / Investor / Advisory Review  
**Project Name:** CampusOS — *The Operating System for Engineering Students*

## 1. Executive Summary (The 30-Second Pitch)

Every year, over 100,000 students join engineering colleges across Karnataka (RVCE, BMSCE, PES, MSRIT, KLS GIT, NIE, VTU main campus, etc.). From Day 1, they face immense information chaos: essential notes, exam dates, and lab record formats are buried across **40+ unorganized WhatsApp groups**, Telegram channels, and confusing college portals.

**CampusOS** replaces this chaos with a single, calm operating system. It gives every student a personalized, semester-by-semester roadmap, an automated **75% VTU attendance & exam risk calculator**, verified senior lab viva playbooks, and an opportunity radar for hackathons and scholarships.

## 2. The Core Problem & Solution

### ❌ The Problem Students Face
1. **Information Chaos:** Important exam notices and notes are lost in 500+ daily chat forwards.
2. **Detention & Attendance Panic:** Students don't know if they are falling below the mandatory **75% VTU attendance cutoff** until detention notices are issued.
3. **CIE Exam Uncertainty:** Internal Assessment (IA) marks are calculated on loose sheets without clear targets for distinction or pass scores.
4. **Senior Guidance Vacuum:** First-year freshers struggle to get reliable advice on lab viva questions and coding roadmaps.

### ✅ The CampusOS Solution
1. **Single Operating Command Center:** Replaces 40+ chat groups with 1 calm workspace.
2. **Predictive 75% Attendance Radar:** Tells students exactly how many safe class bunks they have left before hitting detention risk.
3. **Verified Senior Playbooks:** Provides 100% vetted lab record cheat sheets and viva Q&As from top 3rd/4th-year students.
4. **Dopamine-Driven Daily Action:** Turns chaotic college work into a single **"Today's Mission"** (e.g. *Finish C Pointers Lab Record, 25 mins*).
