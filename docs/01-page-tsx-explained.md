# `app/page.tsx`

## Purpose of this file

`app/page.tsx` is the primary entrypoint page component for the **CampusOS** platform under the Next.js App Router root path (`/`).

It exists to:
1. **Render the CampusOS Landing & Product Overview**: Serve an immersive, high-conversion landing page presenting the core value proposition of CampusOS for Karnataka engineering students.
2. **Provide Interactive Product Demos**: Feature interactive state-driven tab switchers (`Academics`, `CIE & Attendance Radar`, `Senior Playbooks`, `Skill & Career Path`) that demonstrate the CampusOS student dashboard experience in real-time.
3. **Execute Live Calculators**: Run interactive client-side calculators for predicting VTU 75% attendance risk and calculating target Continuous Internal Evaluation (CIE) exam scores needed to hit specific SGPA targets.
4. **Capture Early Access Registrations**: Host the student waitlist form collecting college names, engineering branches, and email addresses.

## When is it executed?

As a Client Component (`"use client"`), `app/page.tsx` undergoes a two-phase lifecycle:

### Execution Lifecycle:
1. **Server SSR Pre-rendering**: On initial page request (`/`), Next.js pre-renders the initial state markup of `page.tsx` inside `app/layout.tsx` on the server to output fast static HTML for SEO indexing.
2. **Client Hydration**: The browser receives the pre-rendered HTML, downloads the JavaScript bundle, attaches React event handlers (`onClick`, `onChange`, `onSubmit`), and initializes client state (`useState`).
3. **Interactive Re-rendering**: User actions (sliding the attendance slider, changing tabs, clicking FAQ accordions) trigger React state updates, re-rendering affected UI blocks dynamically at 60 FPS without page reloads.

## Imports

### `"use client";` (Line 1)
* **What it is**: Next.js App Router boundary directive signaling that this file and its child component tree run on the browser DOM.
* **Why it is used**: Required because the component uses React hooks (`useState`), event handlers (`onClick`, `onChange`, `onSubmit`), and dynamic DOM interactivity.
* **What happens if removed**: Next.js will treat `page.tsx` as a Server Component and fail with a compilation error when encountering `useState` or event handlers.

### `import React, { useState } from "react";` (Line 3)
* **What it is**: Imports core React library and `useState` hook for local component state management.
* **Why it is used**: Manages state for active workspace tabs, attendance percentage, target SGPA, waitlist form inputs, and open FAQ accordion indices.
* **What happens if removed**: `useState` will throw a reference error (`useState is not defined`).

### `import { BookOpen, Calendar, ... } from "lucide-react";` (Lines 4-36)
* **What it is**: Import of 33 vector icons from the modern `lucide-react` icon library.
* **Why it is used**: Visually enriches navigation bars, feature cards, tab controls, status indicators, and call-to-action buttons.
* **What happens if removed**: Icon component tags like `<BookOpen />` will fail with reference errors.

## Interview Questions

### Q1: Why is `use client` required at the top of `app/page.tsx`?
**Answer**: In Next.js App Router, all components are Server Components by default. Because `app/page.tsx` uses state hooks (`useState`), event handlers (`onClick`, `onChange`, `onSubmit`), and dynamic DOM interactions, it must be marked as a Client Component using `"use client"`.

### Q2: What is the performance advantage of derived state calculations (`bunkAllowance`, `reqIAMarks`) over storing them in state?
**Answer**: Storing derived values directly in `useState` creates redundant state synchronization overhead and requires extra `useEffect` re-renders. Calculating derived values synchronously during render ensures optimal performance and prevents out-of-sync state bugs.

### Q3: How does state isolation work in complex single-page layout views?
**Answer**: Component state variables (`activeTab`, `attendance`, `openFaq`) isolate UI changes locally. When the attendance slider moves, React only re-evaluates the simulator widget DOM tree while leaving static sections like the navbar and hero un-mutated.

## Key Concepts Learned

* **Client Component Architecture**: Utilizing `"use client"` for interactive pages.
* **Derived State Optimization**: Calculating dependent values directly during component render.
* **Interactive UI Mockups**: Building realistic multi-tab workspace previews in React.
* **Controlled Form Inputs**: Binding React state (`value`, `onChange`) to HTML form controls.
* **Glassmorphic Component Design**: Combining Tailwind CSS glass panels, ambient radial glows, and responsive grids.

---

## Beginner Notes

* **`useState` Hook**: `const [value, setValue] = useState(initial)` stores data that can change over time. Calling `setValue(newValue)` tells React to re-render the UI with updated values.
* **Controlled Form Inputs**: Setting `value={email}` and `onChange={(e) => setEmail(e.target.value)}` forces the HTML `<input>` to stay perfectly synced with React state.
* **Derived Variables**: `bunkAllowance` is not stored in state; it is automatically re-calculated whenever `attendance` state changes!

---

## What I Should Remember

1. **`"use client"` directive** is mandatory at line 1 when using state or event listeners in App Router pages.
2. **Derived variables** (like `bunkAllowance`) should be calculated during render rather than stored in state.
3. **Mock arrays** (`workspaceTabs`, `faqs`) keep JSX lean and maintainable.
4. **Controlled inputs** ensure form data is captured accurately before submission.
5. **Backdrop blur and glassmorphic panels** create a sleek, modern visual aesthetic.

---

## Common Mistakes Beginners Make

* **Mistake 1**: Creating unnecessary `useEffect` hooks to update derived calculations whenever slider state changes.
* **Mistake 2**: Forgetting `"use client"` on interactive pages containing `useState` or `onClick` handlers.
* **Mistake 3**: Putting huge inline data objects directly inside JSX render functions, causing unnecessary re-allocations on every render.

## Practice Challenge

Without looking at the code, recreate the interactive calculator widget from `app/page.tsx`!

### Hints:
1. Create state for `attendance` (`useState(82)`) and `targetSGPA` (`useState(8.5)`).
2. Calculate `bunkAllowance = Math.max(0, Math.floor((attendance - 75) / 2.5))`.
3. Render two `<input type="range" />` elements bound to `attendance` and `targetSGPA`.
4. Display the calculated bunk allowance and required IA score inside a glassmorphic card container.
